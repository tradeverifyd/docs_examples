title: Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
---

VCs are tamper-resistant, cryptographically verifiable credentials based on the **W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model**. They enable an issuer (e.g., a mill) to sign claims, a holder to control and present them, and a verifier (e.g., CBP) to instantly validate them â€” the **trust triangle**.

**Core fields**: `@context`, `issuer`, `issuanceDate`, `credentialSubject`, `proof`.  
**Security**: Ed25519/JWT proofs; selective disclosure; optional zero-knowledge proofs.  
**Why here**: Faster border clearance, less paper, real-time authenticity, better auditability.
